[⬆ Back to the contents](#contents)

JavaScript is an EDD (Event-Driven Development) language with a functional paradigm and prototype chaining.

TypeScript is the typed, and thus safer, version of JavaScript. Is it recomended? Yes, maybe as a beginner it may be hard, but it sure will be worth it on the long run.
