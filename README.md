## Introduction
[⬆ Back to the contents](#contents)

JavaScript is an EDD (Event-Driven Development) language with a functional paradigm and prototype chaining.

TypeScript is the typed, and thus safer, version of JavaScript. Is it recomended? Yes, maybe as a beginner it may be hard, but it sure will be worth it on the long run.

### React
[⬆ Back to the contents](#contents)

React nurtures from the events, this is something to have in mind while trying to understand React, and probably other JS frameworks.
Created by Meta (previously Facebook), [https://github.com/facebook/react](https://github.com/facebook/react).

Contrary to many other (JS) frameworks out there, React doesn't provide the solutions, rather, it gives you the tools to find the solution that better fits your needs/requirements. But it is true that React is just a library, a really powerful library, but not a framework.

## Lessons

You can also check the lessons content at the [`/lesssons`](./lessons/) folder.

It's categorized to my own like, perspectives, opinions and experience. And it's not necessarily, intermediate do this and that, or this is harder or easier, it's just, maybe, how I would have liked to actually learn react if I were to start all over again.
